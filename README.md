##Brief Description
This project reproduces results from Introduction to Statistical Learning by James, Witten, Hastie, and Tibshirani. We will recreate the regression performed in section 3.2 Multiple Linear Regression. 

##File Structure 
In the code directory you will find all of the scripts, tests, and functions used to reproduce this multiple regression analysis. For the data subdirectory, there is the Advertising data itself along with summary statistics. The images directory contains all of the histogram and plot images created throughout the regression analysis. Finally, there is the report, which has the following outline: 

1. Abstract 
2. Introduction
3. Data 
4. Methodology
5. Results
6. Conclusions
